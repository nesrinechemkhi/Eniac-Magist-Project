# Eniac-Magist-Project
# Project Reflection Template 
## Summary 
This project was created to help make data-driven decisions for Eniac on whether or not they should sign a deal with Magist, based on a database provided by the latter. Eniac's primary goal is to know whether to expand its business in Brazil, specifically with the collaboration of the local company; Magist. 
## Languages and Libraries Used 
The main tools used for this project were Tableau and Google Slides. A secondary tool was used to extract missing tables: MySQL.
## Key Learnings 
Two main aspects of the project were studied: Magist's expertise with Tech products, and Magist's delivery times. Basically, we learned that Magist is doing better both revenue-wise and with delivery delays as well, however, it is not showing as much promise as we expected. We decided to give Magist a one-year trial contract with a probation period and revisit the deal by the end of the trial.
## Challenges Overcame 
Magist's dataset was missing valuable information that could have shifted or enriched our analysis, but we worked with what was provided and tried to extract as much information and conclusions as possible.
